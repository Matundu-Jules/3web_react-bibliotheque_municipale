# Municipal Library

This project is a small frontend application using React, Vite and TypeScript. It allows you to search for books from [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org) and display some details with data coming from Wikipedia.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

The application provides a quick search bar, an advanced search page, a list of recent changes on the home page and a book detail page showing extra information from Wikipedia.
